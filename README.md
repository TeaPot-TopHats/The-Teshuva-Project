# The Teshuva Project

**`A TeaPot-TopHats Team Project`**

## The Idea:
A fast-paced, 2D, top-down, survival, rogue-like, hashmap, mainframe, ripple blockchain enabled, pancake sort, game(TM) with bullet hell aspects where the
objective is to survive waves of enemies. Upgrade your skills after completing a wave, get potions as you play but use them cleverly since you can only hold 3 at a time, obtain new and more powerful weapons as you play, play in differently themed locations,
dying resets your inventory and skills except for holy boons granted by the Church. These holy boons can be obtain by redeeming indulgences dropped from bosses. You'll be able to choose from a few starter
characters every time you start a game that have different abilities and buffs.
