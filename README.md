# The Teshuva Project

**`A TeaPot-TopHats Team Project`**

## Reminder for the boys:
The objective is to make a solid game. <em><strong>So don't be lazy xD</strong></em>

## Game:
A 2D, isometric, survival, rogue-like, hashmap, mainframe, ripple blockchain enabled, pancake sort, game(TM) with bullet hell aspects where the
objective is to survive waves of enemies. Upgrade your skills and weapons every round, play in differently themed locations,
dying resets your inventory and skills except those purchased from the main shop. You'll be able to choose from a few starter
characters every time you start a match that use different weapons and have different abilities.
